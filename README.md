Key Master
==========
An Arduino based RFID/NFC door access system that sends users welcome information to LED signs in the hackerspace, as well as pinging the future hackerspace website to count user visits to the space.

Features
--------
* Use any RFID/NFC device to check-in to a hack session.
* Sends a welcome message to an LED display.
* POSTs info to the [hackadl.org](http://hackadl.org) website.

Hardware
--------
* ACR122 Contactless Reader

Software
--------
* Python

RaspberryPi
----

When running on a Raspberri Pi, you need to install these:

<code>$ sudo apt-get install python-pyscard</code><br />
<code>$ sudo apt-get install pcscd</code><br />
<code>$ sudo apt-get install pcsc-tools</code>

If the reader isn't showing up, solve it using this:
http://enjoy-rfid.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/raspberry-pi-nfc.html

Which gets you to create a blacklist file:
<code>/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf</code>

	blacklist pn533
	blacklist nfc
	
**Wifi**

To use a TP-Link TL-WN322G Wifi USB, install:

<code>$ sudo apt-get install zd1211-firmware</code>

Then add the wireless hotspot information by running:

<code>$ wpa_passphrase ssid-name passphrase > tmp.txt</code>

<code>$ sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c tmp.txt</code>

You might need to restart the Pi, but it should be able to connect then.

***Wifi Troubleshooting***

I'm not sure the above commands will set up automatic connect, you might need to add something like this to /etc/network/interfaces:

	# comment out these lines that are there by default
	#iface wlan0 inet manual
	#wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

	auto wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet dhcp

		wpa-ssid the_ssid
		#psk="the_passphrase" # just for reference
		wpa-psk <long hex string generated by wpa_passphrase in tmp.txt>

**GPIO pins**

Using *wiringpi2*

<code>$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip</code>

<code>$ sudo pip install wiringpi2</code>

Then with the RaspberryPi pointing with the SD card to the top, connect the buzzer to:

* Ground to the third pin down from the top on the right column.
* Power to the eighth pin down from the top on the right column.

Run the Hackerspace card reader on boot
---

To get this script to run at boot, add the following line to <code>/etc/rc.local</code>

<code>echo -n 'p\nc\n' | python /home/pi/hackerspace/Key-Master/keymaster.py | logger -t keymaster &</code>

The ```echo``` command enters 'p' for production, and 'c' for checkin.
It then tries to run the python script, and output that to logger with the tag 'keymaster'. The ```&``` symbol makes it run in the background.
